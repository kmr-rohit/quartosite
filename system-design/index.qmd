Welcome to my System Design learning journey! This section covers scalable architecture patterns, distributed systems, and real-world system design challenges.

<!-- ## Quick Navigation -->


## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's about making trade-offs between different aspects like:

- **Scalability**: How well the system handles growth
- **Reliability**: How often the system fails
- **Availability**: How much time the system is operational
- **Performance**: How fast the system responds
- **Maintainability**: How easy it is to modify and extend

## System Design Interview Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, availability
- **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, technology stack

### 2. Capacity Planning
- **Traffic Estimation**: Requests per second, data storage needs
- **Storage Calculation**: Data size, growth rate
- **Bandwidth Requirements**: Network capacity needed

### 3. High-Level Design
- **System Architecture**: Overall structure and components
- **Database Design**: Data models and storage strategies
- **API Design**: Interface definitions and protocols

### 4. Detailed Design
- **Component Design**: Individual service specifications
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Error Handling**: Failure scenarios and recovery

## Key Concepts

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more resources to existing machines
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers

### Availability
- **Redundancy**: Multiple copies of critical components
- **Failover**: Automatic switching to backup systems
- **Data Replication**: Keeping data synchronized across locations

### Consistency
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
- **Eventual Consistency**: Data becomes consistent over time

### Performance
- **Latency**: Time to respond to a request
- **Throughput**: Number of requests handled per unit time
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data

## Common System Design Topics

### Web Applications
- **Client-Server Architecture**
- **RESTful APIs**
- **Microservices**
- **API Gateway Pattern**

### Data Storage
- **Relational Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
- **Data Warehousing**: BigQuery, Snowflake
- **CDN**: Content Delivery Networks

### Messaging Systems
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Pub/Sub Pattern**

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Logging**: Centralized log management
- **Metrics**: Performance monitoring
- **Tracing**: Distributed request tracking
- **Alerting**: Proactive issue detection
