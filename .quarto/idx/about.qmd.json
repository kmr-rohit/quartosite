I've recently discovered my interest in tech blogging and writing, and I'm enthusiastic about sharing insights and knowledge from the ever-evolving world of technology.\n:::\n\n## Who I Am\n\nI'm a software developer passionate about continuous learning and sharing knowledge. This wiki serves as my digital garden where I document my learning journey, organize technical knowledge, and share insights with the developer community.\n\n## What This Wiki Is\n \n### üéØ **Learning Journey**\nThis wiki tracks my progress through four main areas of software development:\n- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Core computer science fundamentals\n- **System Design**: Scalable architecture and distributed systems\n- **Technical Blogs**: Analysis of engineering articles and insights\n- **Books**: Reading notes and summaries from technical literature\n\n### üìö **Knowledge Base**\nA comprehensive collection of:\n- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations and solutions\n- **Architecture Patterns**: System design principles and trade-offs\n- **Best Practices**: Industry standards and proven approaches\n- **Learning Resources**: Curated materials and references\n\n### üå± **Digital Garden**\nA living document that:\n- **Grows Over Time**: New content added regularly\n- **Connects Ideas**: Links between related concepts\n- **Evolves**: Content updated as my understanding deepens\n- **Shares Knowledge**: Open for others to learn from\n\n## Education üéì\n\n**Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering** - [2020 - 2024]  \n*National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India*  \n**CGPA**: 7.34 / 10\n\n### Coursework includes:\n- Object-Oriented Programming using Java\n- Data Structure and Algorithms\n- Numerical and Statistical Methods\n- Linear Algebra & Calculus\n\n## Work Experience üßë‚Äçüíª\n\n### **Application Developer Intern, Oracle**\n- Developed and implemented a \"Copy Data\" button using JavaScript, Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (OJET), and Visual Builder Cloud Service (VBCS). The button facilitated the copying of data for lead time columns, streamlining the process for the Supply Planning Team.\n- Utilized ElasticSearch REST endpoints to efficiently bind data to tables, ensuring seamless data retrieval and display in the application.\n- Implemented data update functionality using PATCH requests, enabling real-time and incremental updates for changed data in the application.\n- Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis and visualization by incorporating Trendline functionality in OJET charts using Linear Regression. This addition allowed for trend identification and better data-driven decision-making.\n\n## Achievements üèÖ\n\n- **Conducted 15+ Competitive Programming Contests** for Students along with Discussions\n- **Qualified Internal Round** for Smart India Hackathon 2022\n- **600+ problems solved** on LeetCode, Geeks for Geeks, CodeChef, CodeForces etc.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n### **Languages & Frameworks**\n- **Java**: Object-Oriented Programming and backend development\n- **JavaScript**: Web development and Oracle VBCS\n- **Python**: Algorithms, data science, and machine learning\n- **React/NextJS**: Currently learning modern web development\n- **SQL**: Database design and optimization\n\n### **Tools & Platforms**\n- **Git**: Version control and collaboration\n- **Oracle VBCS**: Cloud application development\n- **ElasticSearch**: Data search and analytics\n- **OJET**: Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit\n\n### **Areas of Focus**\n- **Competitive Programming**: 600+ problems solved across platforms\n- **Web Development**: Learning React and NextJS\n- **Open Source**: Exploring and contributing to projects\n- **Machine Learning**: Exploring AI/ML technologies\n\n\n## Get in Touch\n\nI'm always interested in connecting with other developers and learners.
