# Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array.

## Explanation

Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array.

```cpp
int kadane(int arr[], int n) {
    int max_current = 0;
    int max_global = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        max_current = max(arr[i], max_current + arr[i]);
        max_global = max(max_global, max_current);
    }
    return max_global;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- `kadane` is O(n) operation.

## Space Complexity

- `kadane` is O(1) operation.
