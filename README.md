# Developer Learning Wiki

A comprehensive learning wiki built with Quarto to document my journey as a software developer. This wiki covers four main areas of focus:

## 🎯 Learning Areas

### 1. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
- Core data structures implementation
- Algorithm analysis and optimization
- Problem-solving strategies
- Practice problems and solutions

### 2. **System Design**
- Architectural patterns and principles
- Scalability techniques
- Real-world case studies
- Design trade-offs and decisions

### 3. **Technical Blog Breakdowns**
- Analysis of engineering blog posts
- Key insights and takeaways
- Implementation notes
- Quick reference summaries

### 4. **Books & Reading**
- Reading lists and recommendations
- Book notes and summaries
- Learning progress tracking
- Knowledge synthesis
